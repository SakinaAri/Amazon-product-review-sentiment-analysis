### **1. Problem Statement**

It is observed that the maximum number of customers look at product reviews before they make a purchase. Survey results show that positive product reviews are a key factor for purchasing by 57% of Amazon buyers (Statista, 2019). 

As product reviews are often the deciding factor for many customers, it’s very important to have a well-automated system for monitoring them.

The traditional manual process of Amazon product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient when millions of reviews are being posted all the time. It doesn’t show any trend or patterns over time. Moreover, it is tough to understand customers’ sentiment towards any product or its delivery.

### **2. My Approach**

I will be classifying Amazon customer reviews from the source files mentioned below, into 3 categories of positive, negative and neutral. We used Text Classification and Time Series Analysis to solve this problem statement.  

We developed an automated system to analyze and monitor an enormous number of reviews. By monitoring the entire review history of products, we analyzed the tone, language, keywords, and trends over time to provide valuable insights that increase the success rate of existing and new products as well as marketing campaigns.
